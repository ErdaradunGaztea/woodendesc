{woodendesc} strives to provide an unified API to query any R repository for the following data:

* list of available packages,
* version code of any selected package,
* direct dependencies of any selected package.

The package tries to cache as much as possible and reuse existing cache wherever possible to minimize internet usage. Many repositories (CRAN, Bioconductor, R-universe, and local libraries) have custom implementations of their handlers to make use of additional possibilities they present (e.g. previous versions on CRAN or old releases of Bioconductor).

## Installation

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("woodendesc")
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("turtletopia/woodendesc")
```

## How to use woodendesc?

Each repository has its dedicated functions for listing available packages, package version, and package dependencies.

A list of available packages is returned as a character vector. An example call returning a list of CRAN packages:

```{r demo_cran_pkgs, cache=TRUE}
library(woodendesc)
# Too many packages to list them all
all_cran_pkgs <- wood_cran_packages()
head(all_cran_pkgs, 10)
```

An available package version is returned as a single code. An example call checking the current version of Biobase package on Bioconductor:

```{r demo_bioc_version, cache=TRUE}
wood_bioc_version("Biobase")
```

Dependencies of a package are returned as a data frame with the same set of columns for all calls. An example call for locally installed digest package (dependency of woodendesc):

```{r demo_local_deps, cache=TRUE}
wood_local_dependencies("digest")
```

Note that some repositories store more than just one version of a package (e.g. CRAN and Github). These cases can be distinguished by pluralized `_versions` function name component and they return all version codes instead; a character vector of any length. This is how it works for gglgbtq on Github:

```{r demo_gh_versions, cache=TRUE}
wood_github_versions("gglgbtq", "turtletopia")
```

If a single version code is needed, there's a counterpart that selects the latest version only. The current version of aurrera on Github is:

```{r demo_gh_latest, cache=TRUE}
wood_github_latest("aurrera", "turtletopia")
```

Last, but not least, there are three functions for searching through multiple repositories and collecting the results. Read the documentation for details on how to specify `repos` parameter.

`wood_packages()` collects available packages from the specified repositories and returns unique elements:

```{r demo_wood_packages, cache=TRUE}
wood_packages(repos = c("core", "https://colinfay.me"))
```

`wood_versions()` returns all package versions available on at least one of the specified repositories; may take more than one package:

```{r demo_wood_versions, cache=TRUE}
wood_versions(
  c("aurrera", "woodendesc"),
  repos = c("local#all", "runiverse@turtletopia", "cran")
)
```

`wood_dependencies()` returns a list of package dependencies, a data frame for each package specified; the first working repository is used for each package, as the dependencies are not supposed to be summable:

```{r demo_wood_deps, cache=TRUE}
wood_dependencies(
  c("versionsort", "gglgbtq"),
  repos = c("local#all", "runiverse@turtletopia", "cran")
)
```

And if you ever need to clear cache, simply call:

```{r clear_cache}
wood_clear_cache()
```

## End notes

I believe in equal rights and treatment for everybody, regardless of their sexuality, gender identity, skin tone, nationality, and other features beyond human control. Thus, I do not allow woodendesc to be used in any project that promotes hate based on the aforementioned factors.
