# woodendesc (development version)

* Reimplemented the code, replacing {httr} with {httr2}.
* Updated code to reflect API changes in Bioconductor and R-universe.
* Bioconductor data for releases 1.5-1.7 is no longer available.
* Dropped support for older R versions (< 4.1.0) because they increased maintenance complexity significantly.

# woodendesc 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
