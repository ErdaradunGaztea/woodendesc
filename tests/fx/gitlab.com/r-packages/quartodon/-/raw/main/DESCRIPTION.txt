Description: To compose 'Mastodon' posts, a plain text file can be used. Given
    the functionality offered by packages such as 'quarto', 'blogdown', and
    'distill', it makes sense to compose toot threads as blog posts. The
    'quartodon' package allows you to extract the toots from such blog posts
    and then post them to Mastodon as a thread.
