Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: Its simple separation of content and styling
             makes Markdown well-suited for development of
             course material. Including R chunks allows
             directly producing plots and tables, and the
             support for math expressions enables including
             equations. Markdown for Education preprocesses
             (R) Markdown files and exports them to HTML
             to be imported into a Learning Management System,
             also offering functionality for itembank
             production.
